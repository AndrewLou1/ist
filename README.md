# Functionality:

* Retrieve weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) for the specified city using an open
weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
* Make data available to the application.
* Display the weather information to the user.
* Record the user interaction.
* Display past interactions (while in the runtime session)
User Interface:
* The app should have a simple command-line interface.
* Prompt the user to look up world weather using appropriate menu-options.
* Display the weather details (e.g., temperature, conditions) for that city.
* Allow the program to exit without errors.
* Allow the use to ask for ‘help’.
* Handle user errors and exceptions gracefully.
API Integration:
* Use the requests library to fetch weather data from an open-source API
(https://openweathermap.org/)
* Handle API responses (e.g., error handling and messaging)
Documentation:
* Include comments in your code to explain each function and major steps.
* Write a brief README file describing how to run the app and any dependencies.
