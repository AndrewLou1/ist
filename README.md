# Functionality:
The app should allow users to look up the weather around the world. It should detect user errors
such as spelling or unexpected inputs. It should account for the use of upper- and lower-case
characters. It should handle errors and exceptions gracefully and prevent run-time errors.
 Retrieve weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) for the specified city using an open
weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
 Make data available to the application.
 Display the weather information to the user.
 Record the user interaction.
 Display past interactions (while in the runtime session)
User Interface:
 The app should have a simple command-line interface.
 Prompt the user to look up world weather using appropriate menu-options.
 Display the weather details (e.g., temperature, conditions) for that city.
 Allow the program to exit without errors.
 Allow the use to ask for ‘help’.
 Handle user errors and exceptions gracefully.
API Integration:
 Use the requests library to fetch weather data from an open-source API
(https://openweathermap.org/)
 Handle API responses (e.g., error handling and messaging)
Documentation:
 Include comments in your code to explain each function and major steps.
 Write a brief README file describing how to run the app and any dependencies.
